When the author saw Winograd using SHRDLU, they believed that teaching the computer more words was all that was needed to bring about significant advancements in AI. However, during the author's first year of graduate school, they came to realize that AI as practiced at the time was a hoax. They eventually decided to pursue art instead, realizing that paintings were something that could be created and enjoyed without becoming obsolete.

People can't sit for more than about 15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still. So the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person you're painting.\n","Predicted Answer:  The main difference between painting still lives and painting people is that people are dynamic and constantly moving while still lifes remain stationary. As a result, painting people requires the artist to capture their movement and expression accurately whereas still lives can be copied pixel by pixel from what the artist sees.\n","Predicted Grade:  CORRECT\n","\n","Example 5:\n","Question: What did the author learn while working at Interleaf?\n","Real Answer: The author learned that low end software tends to eat high end software, that it's better for technology companies to be run by product people than sales people, that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people, that cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that planned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big, bureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that there's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the optimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal place for it.\n","Predicted Answer:  The author learned that technology companies should be run by product people rather than salespeople, that editing code by multiple people can lead to bugs, that cheap office space can be depressing, that planned meetings are less effective than informal conversations, that large, bureaucratic customers can be risky sources of money, and that the optimal time for hacking and office space for programming differ from traditional office hours.\n","Predicted Grade:  CORRECT\n","\n","Example 6:\n","Question: What did the author do to survive during the next several years after leaving RISD?\n","Real Answer: The author did freelance work for the group that did projects for customers to survive for the next several years after leaving RISD.\n","Predicted Answer:  The author worked as a programmer at various companies and eventually started his own business, Viaweb, which became Yahoo Storefronts.\n","Predicted Grade:  CORRECT\n","\n","Example 7:\n","Question: What was the author's motivation for wanting to become rich?\n","Real Answer: The author wanted to become rich so that he could work on whatever he wanted.\n","Predicted Answer:  We don't know.\n","Predicted Grade:  INCORRECT\n","\n","Example 8:\n","Question: What is Viaweb and how did it get its name?\n","Real Answer: Viaweb is a company that built a web app for creating online stores.

Its goal was to create an easy-to-use and inexpensive solution for online stores, which eventually led to its acquisition by Yahoo in 1998. The name \"Viaweb\" came from combining the words \"via\" (meaning \"path\" or \"way\") with \"web\", referring to the World Wide Web.\n","Predicted Grade:  CORRECT\n","\n","Example 9:\n","Question: What was the price charged by Viaweb for a small store and a big one?\n","Real Answer: $100 a month for a small store and $300 a month for a big one.\n","Predicted Answer:  The price charged by Viaweb for a small store was $100 per month and for a big one it was $300 per month.\n","Predicted Grade:  CORRECT\n","\n","Example 10:\n","Question: Why did the author hire more people for his startup?\n","Real Answer: The author hired more people for his startup partly because the investors wanted him to and partly because that's what startups did during the Internet Bubble.\n","Predicted Answer:  The author hired more people for his startup because (a) he wanted to increase the size of his team, (b) his investors wanted him to, or (c) it was a common practice among startups during the Internet Bubble.\n","Predicted Grade:  CORRECT\n","\n","Example 11:\n","Question: What was the author's idea for a new company?\n","Real Answer: The author's idea was to build a web app for making web apps, where people could edit code on their server through the browser and then host the resulting applications for them.\n","Predicted Answer:  The author's idea for a new company was to put art galleries online.\n","Predicted Grade:  CORRECT\n","\n","Example 12:\n","Question: What was the author's turning point in figuring out what to work on?\n","Real Answer: The author's turning point in figuring out what to work on was when he started publishing essays online.\n","Predicted Answer:  The author's turning point in figuring out what to work on was when he started publishing essays online.\n","Predicted Grade:  CORRECT\n","\n","Example 13:\n","Question: What is the danger for the ambitious according to the text?\n","Real Answer: The desire to impress people is the danger for the ambitious according to the text.\n","Predicted Answer:  The danger for the ambitious is the desire to impress people.\n","Predicted Grade:  CORRECT\n","\n","Example 14:\n","Question: What is the most distinctive thing about Y Combinator?\n","Real Answer: The most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund a bunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then to spend three months focusing intensively on trying to help them.\n","Predicted Answer:  One of the most distinctive things about Y Combinator is its origins - it was originally called Cambridge Seed and was founded by Paul Graham before becoming known as Y Combinator. Another distinctive aspect of Y Combinator is its focus on early stage startup companies and its use of a \"bootcamp\" style program to help founders develop their ideas into successful businesses. Additionally, Y Combinator has a unique approach to funding, using a combination of seed funding and mentorship to support entrepreneurs rather than traditional venture capital methods.\n","Predicted Grade:  CORRECT\n","\n","Example 15:\n","Question: What was the Summer Founders Program and how many groups were selected for funding?\n","Real Answer: The Summer Founders Program was a program for undergrads to apply for funding for their startup ideas. 8 groups were selected for funding out of 225 applications.\n","Predicted Answer:  The Summer Founders Program was a program created by Paul Graham to fund startups. He used his own building in Cambridge as the headquarters and held dinners every Tuesday where he brought in experts on startups to speak.
